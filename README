 
   RainTPL
-------------

The easy and fast template engine for PHP.   Rain.TPL makes application easier to create & enables designers/developers to work better together.


version 2.6.1 beta

feature:

- you can modifiers on string, number, constant and variables, or just as function:
{"hello"|get_msg} // for the language
{#URL|basename}  // take "index.php"
{1024|byte_format} // print 1 KB
{|php_info} // instead of {function="phpinfo"}
probably in next version we'll put {function} as deprecated


- removed the PHP load view, use instead the View class of rainframework
- added path_replace configuration, is now possible to set what html elements to replace the path 
	* raintpl::$path_replace, to enable/disable the path replace
	* raintpl::$path_replace_list = array( 'a', 'img', 'script', 'link' )

- code optimized
- fixed for php-eating-newline-after-closing-tag
- assign() method improved, object are not anymore converted to array


- bug fix:
 * in compileFile added '*.php' to unlink: array_map( "unlink", glob( $this->tpl['cache_dir'] . $this->tpl['tpl_basename'] . "*.php" ) );
